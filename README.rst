Project layout
==============

The project layout was made in such a way that code is seperated from non-code
files that you typically want to serve in another way (static and media files)
or keep in a different location (like the virtual environment)::

    langerak_gkv
    |
    +-- env                 -- Virtual environment files.
    |
    +-- src                 -- Container for one or more source directories.
    |   |
    |   +-- langerak_gkv
    |       |
    |       +-- conf        -- Django settings files.
    |       |
    |       +-- templates   -- Project templates
    |       |
    |       +-- wsgi        -- Default location for wsgi deployment scripts
    |       |
    |       +-- static      -- Default location for project static files
    |       |
    |       +-- ...         -- Project specific applications.
    |
    +-- static              -- Default location for collected static files.
    |
    +-- media               -- Default location for uploaded media files.
    |
    +-- log                 -- All log files generated by the project.
    |
    +-- doc                 -- Documentation source and generated files.
    |
    +-- requirements        -- Project requirements for each type of installation.
